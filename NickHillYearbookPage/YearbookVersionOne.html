                    played by John McCloskey ('15), brought the<br />
                    outdoors in to teach the foreigner, Charlie,<br />
                    some new words. The part Ellard was perfect<br />
                    for john, as he seemed to become Ellard as<br />
                    he stepped out on stage. "John was so<br />
                    enthusiastic and full of energy, it was always<br />
                    a blast to watch," said Margaret Selkey ('16)<br />

                    shows. 4 <b><i>DINNER AND A SHOW</i></b> Charlie<br />
                    told a story in his "foreign language." In<br />
                    reality, Charlie's language is just gibberish<br />
                    he used to pretend he was a foreigner, which<br />
                    forms the basis of the play. "That picture is<br />
                    one of my favorite scenes, right before Charlie<br />
                    tells a story in his 'language,'" Selkey recalled.<br />
                    "It was so easy to act genuinely excited in<br />
                    that scene because of how perfectly Landon<br />
                    performed it every time!"
