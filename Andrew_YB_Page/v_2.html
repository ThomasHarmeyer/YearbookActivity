                            An event plagued by rain the year before, this year’s Student
                            Council Carnival was again threatened to be reluctantly
                            moved indoors. But luckily the weather cooperated and the
                            event was held out on the front lawn. “This was the first
                            year the carnival was outside - we tried to do it outside
                            last year but it rained. I think it went really well. We were
                            contemplating on moving it inside but then we wouldn’t
                            have been able to tie dye and have some of the inflatables,”
                            said Rachel Kolb (‘16), a co-chair of the event.

                            Made enjoyable by the inclusion of most of the clubs,
                            students were able to walk from booth to booth and
                            participate in activities put on by their fellow students.
                            Jessica Olson (‘18) remembered “activities like dunking
                            teachers in a tank, tie-dye, live music, and they gave away
                            cotton candy and it was actually pretty good.” Evident by the
                            line of students spanning across the parking lot, the free
                            cotton candy was a hit with the students.

                            Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most popular event was
                            the tie-dye spring fling t-shirts hosted by student council.
                            “I think tie dying was also a huge success because you
                            could create your own shirt and personalize it, also student
                            council has never done anything like that before so it was
                            different.”

                        <p class="bodyText">
                            Just a few booths down was the Red Kettle Club table,
                            where club treasurer Lucy Kwiatkowski (‘16) was handing
                            out snow cones, “We went with red snow cones because
                            it’s red kettle club.” The group was attempting to draw in
                            more members, and strangely enough, meeting attendance
                            doubled the next week. Continuing, she said “Looking
                            back, I just remember that my hands were really cold from
                            scooping all the crushed ice.”
